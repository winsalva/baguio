	  <p>Hailed as the Summer Capital of the Philippines, Baguio is the top destination to go to if you want to take 
a break from the tropical heat in the lowlands. With average temperatures ranging from 15-23°C, the city 
rarely experiences temperatures higher than 26°C even during the warmest parts of the year. Because of 
this climate, Baguio is also home to beautiful plants that wouldn’t usually survive elsewhere in the county. 
Also nicknamed the City of Pines, you’ll be in for a treat with all the beautiful flowers and lush vegetation 
	    as you enter the vicinity. It will truly feel as if you’re entering a different world.</p>
	  <p>Besides cooling off to experience the cold climate, the place has a lot more to offer, from abundant flora 
and beautiful parks to unique food and keepsakes. Visit some of these iconic locations: Burnham Park, 
Camp John Hay, and the Baguio Cathedral. You can opt to be one with nature, ride a bike or boat, or even 
shop your heart’s content in the different areas of Baguio. Plus, you can go to a strawberry farm and pick 
some fresh fruits, and maybe also get a taste of strawberry taho! Located in Northern Luzon, this 
mountain resort city is easily accessible by bus or cars—meaning it’s great for spontaneous road trips too. 
If you’re curious to see what’s waiting for you, explore Baguio and check out why local and foreign 
	    travelers alike include this in their Philippine travel bucket list.</p>
